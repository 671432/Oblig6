absolute essentials:
    implement Earth's Moon (done)
    attatch moon to earth orbit (done)
        moon has to rotate around earth, not sun (done)
        moon has to  stay in earth's orbit even when earth is moved by the player. (planet moving feature will be removed)
    teleport Logic (done)
    WASD movement (done, janky, but done)
    Hight Map (when on moon) (done)
        optional: improove heightmap (better textures, make it allign with the holes and mountains from the moon surface, etc)
    Object (Rommskip brum brum)

nice to have:
    jump (speed: 0.8 on mercury | 0.2 on moon)
    mouse movement when on the moon
    mouse lock (maybe on a specific button instead of "onClick")
    info (show player controls at left upper corner on every page, preferably done inside the App.js file and not in HTML)
    copy paste "MoonWalk.js" to new file "MarsWalk.js" and change textures from "moon..." to "mars..."
    fix player height (currently a bit low when walking on the moon, I don't wanna be a midget)
    add space ship sounds
    add light blocking object inside earth so that the moon doesn't light up when the earth is between the sun and the moon.
    add object collision when on moon/mars
    MoonWalk.js should only create visuals (floor, planets, etc), and animations
        everything else should be set in App.js
